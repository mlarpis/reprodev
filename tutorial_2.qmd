You can use [this repository](https://github.com/gerkovink/reprodev-exercise_quarto) as the base for Tutorial 2. 

# Introduction
`git` and `GitHub` are tools that allow you to create a visible portfolio of your work. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a new repository on `GitHub`, forking the repository, creating a new branch, adjusting the compendium, creating a pull request, reviewing the pull request, and merging the pull request.

Finally, we will make the portfolio visible by creating a website rendering and publishing our `Quarto` document to `GitHub Pages`.

## `Git`

`Git` is a free and open source version control system for text files. It can handle extensive change logging for you, no matter the size of the project. `Git` is fast and efficient, but its effectiveness depends also on the frequency you instruct it to log your project's changes.

You can see `Git` as a blank canvas that starts at a certain point in time. Every time you (or others) instruct `Git` to log any changes that have been made, `Git` adds the changes that are made to this canvas. We call the changes to the canvas [`commits`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit). With every `commit` an extensive log is created that includes at least the following information:

-   the changes made
-   who made the changes
-   metadata
-   a small piece of text that describe the changes made

The difference between two commits - or the changes between them - are called [`diffs`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#diff).

If you'd like to know much more about `Git`, [this online book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good resource. If you'd like to practice with the command line interface [use this webpage](https://learngitbranching.js.org) for a quick course. [This book](https://happygitwithr.com) covers pretty much everything you need to marry `Git` and `R`.

## `GitHub`

`GitHub` is the social and user interface to `Git` that allows you to work in [repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository). These repositories can be seen as project folders in which you publish your work, but you can also use them as test sites for development, testing, etcetera. There is a distinction between [private repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#private-repository) (only for you and those you grant access) and public repositories (visible for everyone).

Your public repositories can be viewed and [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) by everyone. `Forking` is when other people create a copy of your repository on their own account. This allows them to work on a repository without affecting the `master`. You can also do this yourself, but then the process is called [`branching`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch) instead of forking. If you create a copy of a repository that is offline, the process is called [`cloning`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#clone).

`GitHub`'s ability to branch, fork and clone is very useful as it allows other people and yourself to experiment on (the code in) a repository before any definitive changes are [`merged`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge) with the `master`. If you're working in a forked repository, you can submit a [`pull request`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request) to the repository collaborators to accept (or reject) any suggested changes.

For now, this may be confusing, but I hope you recognize the benefits `GitHub` can have on the process of development and bug-fixing. For example, the most up-to-date version of the `mice` package in `R` can be directly installed from the `mice` repository with the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "stefvanbuuren/mice")
```

You can see that this process requires package `devtools` that expands the `R` functionality with essential development tools. Loading packages in `R` directly from their respective `GitHub` repositories, allows you to obtain the latest - often improved and less buggy - iteration of that software even before it is published on [`CRAN`](https://cran.r-project.org).

# Exercise

Divide your group in two teams:

Team A will be the owner of the repository. Team B will fork the repository and act as a contributor to the repository. Follow the instructions together and make sure that you understand the process. If you have any questions, please ask me, or Carlos. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## 1. Publish a new repository

First, we will create a new repository with `GitHub` desktop.

1. Choose _File > New Repository_

![](tutorial_2_img/new.png){width=50%}

2. Choose a name for the repository and a location on your computer and click _Create Repository_

- Choose initialise this repository with a README
- Choose MIT License
- Choose `R` for _Git Ignore_ 

![](tutorial_2_img/create.png){width=100%}
3. Now publish the repository to `GitHub` by clicking _Publish Repository_ and follow the instructions.

- Choose a name for the repository
- Untick _Keep this code private_

![](tutorial_2_img/publish.png){width=100%}

Now click _Publish Repository_ and wait for the repo to be published. 

## 2. Add content
This one is easy!

Add the content from Tutorial 1 to the folder that you just created. You can overwrite the `README.md` file with the one from Tutorial 1. There is no need to overwrite the `.gitignore` and `LICENSE` files, if relevant. 

Make sure that you add all files and folders - also the hidden ones - to the `git` repository on your machine.

::: {callout-warning}
### Are all folders detected?
Make sure that all folders in your repo are detected by `git`. If you are using `GitHub Desktop`, you can check this by clicking on the _Changes_ tab. If you are using the command line, you can use the `git status` command.

Depending on your platform, you might need to change the `docs` folder to `doc` or `documents` for it to be detected by `git`. 
:::

After making sure all changes to the folder are detected, create a commit message (`initial commit` is conventional) and click _Commit to main_, followed by _Push origin_.

![](tutorial_2_img/init.png){width=100%}

## 3. Fork the repository
Now the contributors (Team B) will fork the repository.

1. Find the repository on `GitHub` and click _Fork_.
  
  - copying the main branch only will suffice

![](tutorial_2_img/fork.png){width=100%}

2. Clone the repository to your computer by clicking on the green code button and choosing _Open with GitHub Desktop_ as the clone method.

![](tutorial_2_img/clone.png){width=100%}

3. Choose a location on your computer and click _Clone_.

## 3. Create a new branch
Never work on the main branch. Always create a new branch for your work.

![](tutorial_2_img/branch.png){width=100%}

1. Choose _Branch > New Branch_ and give the branch a name.

 - `dev` is a common name for a development branch

![](tutorial_2_img/dev.png){width=100%}

2. Now you can start working on the repository.

## 4. Adjust the compendium
This is a free exercise. You must add something to the  `Quarto` file and re-render. 

1. Use your creativity and add two things to the  `Quarto` file from Tutorial 1. 

 - The funniest image you know or can find
 - The funniest or coolest video you know or can find
 
2. Re-render the `Quarto` file and make sure that the changes are visible in the _html_ folder.

3. Commit the changes to the repository and push the changes to your fork of the repository on `GitHub` by clicking _Push Origin_.

## 5. Create a pull request
Now that you have contributed to the project and have made changes to the repository, you can create a pull request to the main repository.

1. Go to the forked repository on `GitHub` and click on _Compare & pull request_.
![](tutorial_2_img/pr.png){width=100%}

Alternatively, you can click on the _Preview Pull request_ button in `GitHub Desktop`.

![](tutorial_2_img/prgh.png){width=100%}
2. Review the changes that you made and click _Create pull request_.

- choose `main` as the base (destination) repository branch and the branch that your changes are on as the compare branch
- add an informative title and description
- detail the changes that you made
- assign someone to review the pull request (if relevant)

In general, try to make the life of the maintainer as easy as possible by properly documenting your contributions. 

![](tutorial_2_img/prmes.png){width=100%}

## 6. Review and merge the pull request
Now the owner of the repository (Team A) will review the pull request. This is best done in the _Files changed_ tab and by studying the _Commits_ tab. 

![](tutorial_2_img/filch.png){width=100%}

Go through the files and look at the code. Alternatively, you can check out the _PR branch_ in `GitHub Desktop` and see the changes in the files on your machine and the commits in the _Changes_ tab.

![](tutorial_2_img/prbranch.png){width=100%}
If you are happy, you can approve the changes and continue with merging the pull request. Approving is done with the _Review changes_ button under the _Files changed_ tab. It is nice to write a message to the contributor to thank them for their contribution.

Click on _Merge pull request_ and then _Confirm merge_ to merge the pool request. The changes are now merged into the main branch of the repository.

The development cycle is now complete and the contributed changes are part of the main repository.

## 7. Make the portfolio visible
Finally, we will make the portfolio visible by creating a website rendering and publishing our `Quarto` document to `GitHub Pages`.

1. Go to the settings of the repository and scroll down to the _Pages_ section.
2. Choose the `main` branch  as the source for the website and click _Save_. 
![](tutorial_2_img/pages.png){width=100%}

3. Scroll down and choose _Enforce HTTPS_ if available. This allows you to piggyback on the `GitHub` global certificate and have a securely accessible website.
![](tutorial_2_img/https.png){width=100%}

4. Wait for the website to be published. This can take a few minutes. You can check the status of the website by going to the _Actions_ tab of the repository. You can find your website address in the _Pages_ section of the repository settings.
![](tutorial_2_img/where.png){width=100%}

5. Update the README file with a link to the rendered `Quarto` document. If you did not change any parameters, this would be realized by adding the following line to the `README.md` file:

```markdown
The rendered `Quarto` file can be found [here](/doc/reprodev-exercise_quarto.html)
```

Going to your repository webpage on GitHub (often something like https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORYNAME) should now serve you the `README.md` as a landing page, with a working link to your rendered `Quarto` file.

## To continue
If you have time left, you can experiment with making your compendium into a `target`-powered data analylis pipeline. See [this link](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html) for more details.
